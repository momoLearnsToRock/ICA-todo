## Input

The files are maintained on Swaggerhub (https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/ica-egenkontroll/) and there is a github integration
connected to this repository, which means that most activity in this repo will be automatic. Swaggerhub pushes to the SWAGGERHUB branch. From there we manually create a merge request with a nice description, which we then accept.

## Output

The swagger files are stored in both yaml and json format.
Swaggerhub also creates html documentation. The Master branch of htat is published as Github Pages, that you can look at here:

The pages there are the recommended contract between frontend and backend.
